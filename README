PEel -- Open source editing library for PE files
Copyright (C) 2013 - x8esix -- see doc/LICENSE.TXT
==================================================================

Lack of a decent library to manipulate and view PE and PE32+ files 
in both file and virtual alignment, as was needed for multiple 
projects I was working on, created the need for this library. 
At the moment, it currently provides support to manipulate most 
values easily and provides an interface to manipulate PE sections 
and alignments. 

You can find source code in the peel/ directory, and sample 
implementations in the examples/ directory. See the doc/ directory
for more info.
